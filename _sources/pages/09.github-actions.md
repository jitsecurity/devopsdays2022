## Securing via github actions
[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a CI platform builtin to Github that allows us to run CI pipeline upon changes of our code.<br>

We will add these Github actions:
* Secrets using [gitleaks](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gitleaks)
* SAST using [Bandit](). 
* SCA
* IaC scanning using [Kics](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kics-github-action).

Let's begin.<br>
Create this folder in your project's dir `.github/workflows`.<br>
All files should be generated under that folder.

### Gitleaks
Create a file called `gitleaks.yml` and copy this content.

```yaml
name: gitleaks - secret detection
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  scan:
    name: gitleaks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### SAST (Static application security testing)
Let's create this workflow `sast.yml`<br>
and copy this to the file:

```yaml
name: Test SAST Bandit action PR comment

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  kics:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: jpetrucciani/bandit-check@master
```

### SCA - Dependency Check
Let's create this workflow `sca.yml`<br>
and copy this to the file:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: SCA Dependency Check

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  # workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  SCA:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Dependency-Checker
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - run: |
          pip install safety
          safety check -r requirements.txt
```

### IaC Scanning With Kics

```yaml
name: Test KICS action PR comment

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    
jobs:
  kics:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: run kics Scan
      uses: checkmarx/kics-github-action@v1.6
      with:
        path: serverless.yml
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        output_path: myResults/
        ignore_on_exit: results
        enable_comments: true
```
