# DevopsDays 2022 - Jit Workshop
Welcome to the Jit DevopsDays TLV 2022 Workshop.<br>
In this workshop we are going to build our first serverless application.<br>
* We will use the serverless framework CLI to generate our base template.
* We will then install some plugins to help us connect to localstack.
* We will set up localstack using docker and docker-compose
* We will add a DynamoDB Table as code.
* We will extend our application to do CREATE & READ operations.
* We will deploy it using serverless framework to localstack.
* And finally, we will use the Github CI known as Github Actions to run security tools against our code to see if we have any security issues.
