## Let's see the data in DynamoDB
Inside the docker-compose there's section image called dynamodb which runs the dynamodb-admin docker image.<br> 
A reminder:<br>
```yaml
dynamodb:
    image: aaronshaf/dynamodb-admin
    ports:
      - "8001:8001"
    environment:
      - DYNAMO_ENDPOINT=http://localstack:4566
    networks:
      - localstack-net

```
It's a UI interface to view DDB locally.<br>
Go to : `http://localhost:8001/` <br>
You will see the table: `users-table-local`. <br>You can now view your data.
