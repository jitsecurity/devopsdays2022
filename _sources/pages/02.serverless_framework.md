### Installing the Serverless framework cli
Go over to https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started
Run this command: 
```shell
npm install -g serverless@2.72.3
```

verify your version by running: `sls --version` and you should see this line in the console: `Framework Core: 2.72.3`

#### Creating our first app 
We are going to use the serverless framework cli to generate our app. run this command:
```shell
sls
```
We are going to select this template: `AWS - Python - HTTP API`.<br>
Follow the steps in the cli:

* What do you want to make? `AWS - Python - HTTP API`
* What do you want to call this project? `please select a short name. e.g my-app`
* Do you want to deploy your project? (Y/n) `n`
* What org do you want to add this service to? `[Skip]`
* No AWS credentials found, what credentials do you want to use?  `[Skip]` We can skip this step since we are going to work locally.

cd into your project. You will see these files in your project:
* `serverless.yml`
* `package.json`
* `handler.py`
