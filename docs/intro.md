# DevopsDays 2022 - Jit Workshop

In this workshop we are going to build our first serverless application using the serverless framework.
We are then going to deploy it locally to localstack. <br>
Then we'll use the Github CI platform known as Github Actions to add security tools to make sure our application is secure.
