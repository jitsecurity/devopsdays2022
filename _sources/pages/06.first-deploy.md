## Let's deploy our app
Now that we have localstack set up, it's time to deploy our application. Run this command:<br>
```shell
sls deploy --stage local
```

Wait for deployment to complete, and move to the next section.<br>
You could monitor the localstack logs to see how the deployment is moving along.
